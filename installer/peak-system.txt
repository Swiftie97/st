Introduction
------------
The PCAN system of the company PEAK-System Technik GmbH consists of a Collection of
Windows Device Drivers. These allow the Real-time connection of Windowsapplications
to all CAN busses that are physically connected to the PC via a PCAN hardware.

PCAN-Light is a simple programming interface to the PCAN system. Via several
Interface DLLs it is possible to connect own applications to the Device drivers
and the PCAN hardware, to communicate with the CAN busses.

The provided drivers, the PCAN-Light API, and the PCAN-View CAN bus Monitor
software are the feature-reduced versions of the larger software packages
PCAN-Evaluation, PCAN-Developer, or PCAN-Explorer. These can be acquired
separately.

PCAN-Light was enhanced in beginning of December 2009 with some new features (V2.x):

- Possibility to use Events
- Timestamp Information for received CAN Frames
- Information to get easy the used DLL Version

The PCAN-Light V2.x is 100% Software compatible to the PCAN-Light API V1.x

If you like to use our samples, please take care that you copy the required DLLs
into your Application directory, or into the Windows\System32 directory.
32-bit DLLs on 64-bit platforms must be copied into the Application directory or
the Windows\SysWOW64 directory.


PCAN-Basic - the Next Generation of PCAN-Light
----------------------------------------------

The PCAN-Light API will be supported until end of 2010.
In beginning of 2010 PEAK will change to the PCAN-Basic Software API,
which is more comfortable and open for new features.
The main changes to the PCAN-Light DLLs are:

- Only one DLL for all PEAK-CAN hardware.
- Up to 16 CAN channels per hardware type.
- Using Listen Only Mode
- Interne Data Loggerusing the pCAN-Trace / PCAN-Explorer Trace Format
- Possibility to add new functions by using the Set/Get functions.

If you start with a new project, please use the files in the PCAN-Basic directory.
